.. note:: Work in Progress
   This information typing section is a work in progress. The Server documentation
   team started this project mid-2022 and we are in the process of reviewing with 
   the team and discussing the possibility of adoption.

This section contains details about information typing and prototypes showing how 
we can apply this to our documentation. 

What Is Information Typing?
---------------------------

At its best, information typing is being aware of your audience's goal as you 
start to write a page, and keeping the information you write focused on those goals.
Additionally, information typing is: 

- Separating content into categories and delivering roughly one type at a time.

- Understanding the purpose of a page before you write it.

- Answering the user question "why do I care?" or "what does this mean for me?" quickly.

- Using a suggested format to help you get started on a blank page.

What Types of Information are We Talking About?
-----------------------------------------------

We'll begin with three main information types.

- Concept -- A concept page helps a user learn about a concept or new feature. 
  It is intended to answer the questions "what is this?", "why do I care", and "how
  does this work?". The audience for a concept page is users who have never used 
  a particular feature or command. 

- Task -- A task page helps a user do a job. The audience for a task page is 
  users who want to accomplish a task. They may never have completed the task 
  before, may only have done it a few times, or may need a refresher on the steps. 
  The task page should contain all the necessary information for someone to 
  complete the task, any necessary conceptual information, prerequisites, steps, 
  and expected results. 

- Reference -- A reference page delivers granular details about a thing. The 
  audience for reference pages is experienced users. Apart from 
  straightforward reference manual pages, reference pages can be anything that 
  is a bulleted list or primarily a table of information.
