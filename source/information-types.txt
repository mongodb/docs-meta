At its best, information typing is being aware of your audience's goal as you 
start to write a page, and keeping the information you write focused on those goals.

What Is Information Typing?
---------------------------

Information typing is: 

- Separating content into categories and delivering roughly one type at a time.

- Understanding the purpose of a page before you write it.

- Answering the user question "why do I care?" or "what does this mean for me?" quickly.

- Using a suggested format to help you get started on a blank page.

What Types of Information are We Talking About?
-----------------------------------------------

We'll begin with three main information types.

- Concept -- A concept page helps a user learn about a concept or new feature. 
  It is intended to answer the questions "what is this?", "why do I care", and "how
  does this work?". The audience for a concept page is users who have never used 
  a particular feature or command. 

- Task -- A task page helps a user do a job. The audience for a task page is 
  users who want to accomplish a task. They may never have completed the task 
  before, may only have done it a few times, or may need a refresher on the steps. 
  The task page should contain all the necessary information for someone to 
  complete the task, any necessary conceptual information, prerequisites, steps, 
  and expected results. 

- Reference -- A reference page delivers granular details about a thing. The 
  audience for reference pages is experienced users. Apart from 
  straightforward reference manual pages, reference pages can be anything that 
  is a bulleted list or primarily a table of information.
