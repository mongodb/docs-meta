Concept Page Prototype
======================

A concept page helps a user learn about a concept or new feature. 
It is intended to answer the questions "what is this?", "why do I care", and 
"how does this work?". The audience for a concept page is users who have never
used a particular feature or command. 

The title is typically a noun or noun phrase. 

A concept page begins with a brief introduction summarizing its contents, often 
called a short description. The short description explains a little about the 
concept and why the audience should care about it.

Command Syntax (Optional)
-------------------------

If it's appropriate, you may include a code-block with a copyable
prototype to familiarize users with command syntax.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.<method>( {
      /* command fields */
   } )

After the code block, provide a link to the corresponding
:ref:`reference page <meta-reference-prototype>` to provide readers with
complete examples and behavior details. When possible, single-source
code examples and prototypes with the reference page.

.. note::

   For concept pages that have multiple linked tasks, the code example
   should show the most common task we expect users to look for.

Use Cases
---------

This section is a collection of use cases to explain "What do I do with this 
thing?" In general, use cases are short descriptions of how to use a feature. 
They set expectations of when and how you might use a feature  and what 
differentiates this feature from other options.  

Behavior
--------

This section includes stuff you need to know before using a feature. It can be as long
or short as appropriate. Some examples of technical details include:

- Performance considerations / behavior alerts
- Support for a feature (supported in sharded clusters, for example)
- Version support 

Tasks
-----

Link to the most common task pages related to this concept. Linking to all 
task pages isn't necessary here; the goal of this section is to make sure users 
can easily find common related tasks.

- Link one
- Link two
- Link three

Details
-------

This section is a brief unpacking of the technical details. It can be as long
or short as appropriate.

----------

This section appears on every information typed page. It does not replace 
inline linking, but is intended to augment the information on the page with 
related concepts, tasks, and reference material. Use it to link related pages 
that are not already linked above, such as reference information, technical 
deep dives, less commonly used task pages, or related concepts.
