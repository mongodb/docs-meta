Reference Page Prototype
========================

A reference page provides quick information to experienced users of a product. 
Reference pages may describe the use of a method, operator, or database command. 
Information presented as a bulleted list or table is usually a reference page. 
Release notes are another good example of a reference page.

Usually, the title of a reference page is the name of the command, operator, or 
method it describes.

Definition
----------
A reference page begins with a brief introduction summarizing its contents, 
often called a short description. The short description explains a little about 
how the reference material is used, and may link to a concept and/or task page.

Syntax
------
This is the sample syntax with the required parameters. 

.. code-block:: javascript                                                 
                                                                           
   db.adminCommand(                                                        
      {                                                                    
        addShard: "<replica_set>/<hostname><:port>",                       
        maxSize: <size>,                                                   
        name: "<shard_name>"                                               
      }                                                                    
   )  

Command Fields
--------------
The command takes the following fields:

.. list-table::                                                            
   :header-rows: 1                                                         
   :widths: 20 20 10 60                                                       
                                                                           
   * - Field                                                               
                                                                           
     - Type 

     - Necessity                                                               
                                                                           
     - Description

   * - Parameter

     - String

     - Required

     - String

Behaviors
---------
Optional. 

Behaviors should only apply to the operator being described on this page. 

Examples
--------
Optional.

This section could contain examples of the most common usages. We would populate
Reference and Task page examples using includes, so that the examples are written
once, consistent throughout, and easier to update.

If an example is shared between task and reference, it should be written as an
include.

Learn More
----------
This section appears on every information typed page. It does not replace 
inline linking, but is intended to augment the information on the page with 
related concepts, tasks, and reference material. Use it to link related pages 
that are not already linked above, such as reference information, technical 
deep dives, less commonly used task pages, or related concepts.
