The audience for a task page includes users who want to accomplish a
particular goal. They might approach this task for the very first time,
have limited experience, or need a refresher. This page should contain
all the necessary information for someone to complete the task, any
necessary conceptual information, prerequisites, steps, and expected
results.

Task page titles begin with a present-tense action verb. 

A task page begins with a brief introduction summarizing the task, often called 
a short description. The short description briefly explains the task, and  
answers the following questions:

- "What is this task?"

- "What is it used for?"

- "Why do I care?"

This paragraph can include links out to important conceptual information
required for this task.
