The audience for a task page is users who want to accomplish a task. They may 
never have completed the task before, may only have done it a few times, or may 
need a refresher on the steps. The task page should contain all the necessary 
information for someone to complete the task: any necessary conceptual 
information, prerequisites, steps, and expected results. 

Task page titles begin with a present-tense action verb. 

A task page begins with a brief introduction summarizing the task, often called 
a short description. The short description briefly explains the task, and  
answers the questions "What is this task?", "What is it used for?", and "Why do 
I care?". This paragraph can include links out to important conceptual information 
required for this task.

About This Task
---------------

This is optional.

Include important conceptual or behavioral information that's directly relevant 
to the task. If task-related information is extensive, consider a bulleted list 
that contains brief descriptions of important concepts and links to deeper reading.  

Before You Begin
----------------

This is optional.

An ordered or unordered list of any prerequisites for the task.

Steps
-----

These are the steps to complete the task. 

In some cases, we recomend that you use a stepped content approach. In others, 
a single statement and copyable command or syntax example.  In most cases, it's helpful 
to include an example of what a successful result looks like. It could be a 
brief description, code block, or screenshot. 

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Take an action
     
      Say a little more or provide additional substeps or examples.

      .. note:: 
     
         Use admonitions sparingly. This note gives critical context or a tip 
         for step completion. It could also include a link to more 
         context or important information.

   .. step:: Take another action
     
      Say a little more or provide additional substeps or examples.


Example
-------

This is optional.

In some cases, you can work through a specific example throughout the steps. 
In others, it is helpful to show a complete example at the end. In most cases, 
it's helpful to include an example of what a successful result looks like. It 
could be a brief description, code block, or screenshot. 

Next Steps
----------

This is optional.

If there is one or many logical next things to do, you can link to them here.
