.. |manager| replace:: Kay
.. |vp| replace:: Shannon
.. |automationperson| replace:: https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/TECHOPS/[TECHOPS]
.. |mciperson| replace:: mailto:cory.mintz@mongodb.com[Cory Mintz]

Prerequisites
=============

MongoDB requires a GitHub account. 
`Create <https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/>`_ 
and configure a new one for MongoDB work.  

- Ask `IT <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/OFFICEIT>`_ to add your GitHub ID
  to the `10gen <https://github.com/10gen>`_ and `MongoDB
  <https://github.com/mongodb>`_ default groups ``everyone`` and 
  ``everyone-pull-only`` as well as the ``Docs`` usergroup on GitHub.

- Link the account to your MongoDB `corp profile <https://corp.mongodb.com>`_ 
  before continuing with this guide.

Hardware and Software
=====================

- If you are local to an office:
  - You should receive your computer and a backpack on your first day.
  - Keyboards, mice and cables can be acquired through the vending machine using your office badge.

- If you are remote:
  - Your laptop should arrive at your home for your first day. 
  - The backpack you may need to get at a later date.
  - Keyboards, mice and cables can be requested through IT or purchased and expensed with prior approval from |manager|.

Systems Access
==============

Systems Authentication and Authorization
----------------------------------------

Most all systems at MongoDB (See `Systems Checklist
<https://wiki.mongodb.com/display/10GEN/Systems+Checklist>`_ and `Accounts and
Services <https://wiki.mongodb.com/display/OPSIT/MongoDB+Employee%27s+Accounts
+and+Services>`_) use either your JIRA or Gmail ID to authenticate you into
various systems. There are a few exceptions to this general rule:

Ask `TECHOPS <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/TECHOPS/>`_ for an AWS Access
Key and Secret Key for staging content with the ``noc-prod`` account to the
following buckets:

- ``docs-mongodb-org-staging`` 
- ``docs-atlas-staging`` 
- ``docs-cloudmanager-staging``
- ``docs-opsmanager-staging``

.. topic:: Cloud/Ops Manager Team Only

   The following steps are optional. Please continue if you will be working
   with Cloud/Ops Manager.
 
   - File a `TECHOPS <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/TECHOPS/>`_ ticket for
     an AWS Access Key and Secret Key for Cloud/Ops Manager. |vp| must approve
     AWS Keys for Cloud/Ops Manager.
 
   - Cloud Manager and MCI (``mci.mms-build.10gen.cc``) access should be tied 
     to JIRA. Please confirm your access. 
     - Contact |cloudperson| if any issues arise with:
       - Cloud Manager (``cloud.mongodb.com``)
       - Cloud Manager QA (``cloud-qa.mongodb.com``)
       - Cloud Manager Dev (``cloud-dev.mongodb.com``)
     - Ask |mciperson| for access issues with MCI.

Calendars
---------
