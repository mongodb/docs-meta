Procedures
==========

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. include:: /includes/styles/corrections.rst

Procedures visually separate multi-step processes into individual steps.
Use procedures whenever stepped instructions require any of the following:

- code blocks
- significant explanation (more than a sentence)
- images

Procedure Types
---------------

The following table shows the different styles of procedure and the
syntax required to generate those styles. If you omit the ``style``,
procedures default to a value of ``connected``.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40 60
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Syntax
     - Rendered Result

   * - .. include:: /includes/procedure-example-default.rst
     - .. literalinclude:: /includes/procedure-example-default.rst
          :copyable: false

   * - .. include:: /includes/procedure-example-connected.rst
     - .. literalinclude:: /includes/procedure-example-connected.rst
          :copyable: false

   * - .. include:: /includes/procedure-example-normal.rst
     - .. literalinclude:: /includes/procedure-example-normal.rst
          :copyable: false

   * - **compact style does not render on non-landing pages**
     - .. literalinclude:: /includes/procedure-example-compact.rst
          :copyable: false

.. warning:: Compact Style

   The ``compact`` style option only displays on landing pages. On all
   other content pages, the directive does not render at all.

Procedure Guidelines
--------------------

When creating procedures, use the following guidelines:

- ``normal``: Best for high levels of abstraction.
- ``connected``: Useful for quick starts and tutorials.
- ``compact``: Reserved for docs landing pages *only*.

You may find YAML step files in existing documentation
(e.g. :file:`/source/includes/steps-example.yaml`). When possible,
convert these YAML step files to rST procedures. You can do this manually,
or via a `script <https://github.com/mongodben/rst-parser/tree/master/parser/convert-step-yaml-to-procedure-steps-directive>`__.
