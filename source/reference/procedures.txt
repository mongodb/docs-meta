Procedures separate multi-step processes into individual steps.
Use procedures whenever stepped instructions require any of the following:

- code blocks
- significant explanation (more than a sentence)
- images

Procedure Types
---------------

The following table shows the different styles of procedure and the
syntax required to generate those styles.

Procedure Guidelines
--------------------

When creating procedures, use the following guidelines:

- `normal`: use most of the time.
- `connected`: use mostly for longer procedures and for getting started quick starts.
- `compact`: is reserved for using on docs landing pages only.

You may find YAML step files in existing documentation,
e.g. :file:`/source/includes/steps-example.yaml`. When possible,
convert these YAML step files to rST procedures. You can do this manually,
or via a `script <https://github.com/mongodben/rst-parser/tree/master/parser/convert-step-yaml-to-procedure-steps-directive>`.
