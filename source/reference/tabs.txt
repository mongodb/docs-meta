Tabs organize and allow navigation between groups of related content at
a single level of hierarchy. Use tabs whenever your information branches into
multiple orthogonal environments, but only one of those environments
applies to a user at a time. For example, you could create a set of tabs
to organize documentation for:

- SDKs targeting different platforms
- Operating systems where a user might run software
- Product behavior before and after a breaking environment change
- Code snippets duplicated across multiple languages

Tab Types
---------

Tabs come in two flavors:

- pre-configured tab sets defined in Snooty via ``rstspec.toml``.
- custom tab sets defined directly in your code

Pre-configured Tab Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use a pre-configured tab set, you'll need to know:

- a tab set name
- the tab set ids with titles defined for that tab set

You can find the definitions for all preconfigured tab sets in `rstspec.toml
<https://github.com/mongodb/snooty-parser/blob/78631219292a1e24502a3dee5ed50c83501a0528/snooty/rstspec.toml#L1802=>`__.
Under the ``[tabs]`` section of this file, tabs are defined in the
following form:

.. code-block::

   cloud-providers = [
      {id = "aws", title = "AWS"},
      {id = "azure", title = "Azure"},
      {id = "gcp", title = "GCP"},
   ]

The above tab set has a tab set name of "cloud-providers" and the
following tab set ids:

- "aws" (titled "AWS")
- "azure" (titled "Azure")
- "gcp" (titled "GCP")

To use a pre-configured tab set, use a directive of the form
``tabs-<tab set name>``. Create tabs using ``tab`` directives. Tab
titles come from ``tabid`` option values: pick an id from the tab set,
and Snooty automatically assigns a title.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 60 40
   :header-rows: 1

     - Result

   * - .. literalinclude:: /includes/tabs-example-preconfigured.rst
          :copyable: false
     - .. include:: /includes/tabs-example-preconfigured.rst

Custom Tab Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use a custom tab set, use a ``tabs`` directive. Within that directive,
use ``tab`` directives to define tab titles and ids. Specify the title
as the argument for the ``tab`` directive, and tab ids using the
``tabid`` option. Tab ids keep selected tabs in sync across an entire
page: if the user selects a tab anywhere on the page, all tab sets that
contain that id will switch to that tab.

The following table shows an example of pre-configured tab sets
and an example of custom tab sets:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 60 40
   :header-rows: 1

   * - .. literalinclude:: /includes/tabs-example-custom.rst
          :copyable: false
     - .. include:: /includes/tabs-example-custom.rst

Hidden Tabs
~~~~~~~~~~~

You can add the ``:hidden:`` option to any pre-configured or custom tabs
directive to hide the tab titles and tab selector GUI on that tabset.
This can be useful when you want to offer a tab option at the top of a
page, but that option isn't useful further down the page. For example,
a tutorial with multiple sequential steps (some common between
environments, some tabbed) could benefit from hiding tabs after the first
step, since users aren't likely to switch between tabs in the middle of
the tutorial.

Tab Guidelines
--------------

When creating tabs, use the following guidelines:

- If a pre-configured tab set exists, use it instead of defining a custom
  tab set. This keeps titles consistent across the docs and makes it easier
  to update all similar tab sets if the tab set gains a new option
  (e.g. a new OS version release).
- When defining multiple tab sets on the same page, use the same tabs on
  all tabsets. For instance, if you provide separate "Linux", "Windows",
  and "macOS" tabs at one point on a page, you should provide all of
  those options for each tabset, even if the Linux and macOS tabs
  include the same content.
