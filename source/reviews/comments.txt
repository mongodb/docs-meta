How To Write Code And Copy Review Comments
==========================================

Summary
-------

- Be kind.
- Explain your reasoning.
- Balance giving explicit directions with just pointing out problems and letting
  the author decide.
- Encourage authors to simplify code or add code comments instead
  of just explaining the complexity to you.
- Encourage authors to simplify explanations when appropriate. We're all
  smart, but smart words take more time to read. Readers prefer
  conciseness and the simplest explanation in most situations.

Label Comments
++++++++++++++

Label comments similar to `Conventional Comments <https://conventionalcomments.org/>`__
so the reviewee understands this is a suggestion, issue, question, or comment.

- **No "nits"**.
- Issues are **always** blocking.
- Suggestions **may** be blocking. If they are, label them as such.
  You **must** include a substantive suggestion, not a suggestion disguised
  as a comment.
- Questions are **never** blocking on their own.
- Comments are **never** blocking.

.. example::

   .. code:: sh

      **suggestion: (non-blocking)**
      **suggestion: (blocking)**
      **issue**
      **question**
      **comment**

Courtesy
++++++++

In general, it is important to be :ref:`courteous and respectful <pr-courtesy>`
while also being clear and helpful to the author whose content you are
reviewing. One way to do this is to be sure that you are always making comments
about the *content* and never making comments about the *author*. You don't
always have to follow this practice, but you should definitely use it when
saying something that might otherwise be upsetting or contentious.

.. example::

   Bad: \*\*question\*\* Why did **you** use a semicolon to join two unrelated
   clauses?

   Good: \*\*suggestion: (blocking)\*\* Semicolons should only be used to
   join two related independent clauses in place of a comma and coordinating
   conjunction. Here's how you'd use a semicolon in this instance...


Explain Why
+++++++++++

One thing you'll notice about the "good" example from above is that it helps the
author understand *why* you are making your comment. You don't always need to
include this information in your review comments, but sometimes it's appropriate
to give a bit more explanation around your intent, the best practice you're
following, or how your suggestion improves code health.

Giving Guidance
+++++++++++++++

**In general it is the author's responsibility to fix a PR, not the reviewer's.**
You are not required to do detailed design of a solution or write
content for the author.

This doesn't mean the reviewer should be unhelpful, though. In general you
should strike an appropriate balance between pointing out problems and providing
direct guidance. Pointing out problems and letting the developer make a decision
often helps the author learn, and makes it easier to do reviews. It also
can result in a better solution, because the author is closer to the content
than the reviewer is.

That said, sometimes direct instructions, suggestions, or even content are more
helpful. The primary goal of review is to get the best PR possible. A
secondary goal is improving the skills of authors so that they require less
and less review over time.

Remember that people learn from reinforcement of what they are doing well and
not just what they could do better. If you see things you like in the PR,
comment on those too! Examples: author cleaned up a messy paragraph, added
new examples or tests, or you as the reviewer learned something from the PR.
Just as with all comments, include why you liked something, further encouraging
the author to continue good practices.

Accepting Explanations
++++++++++++++++++++++

If you ask a author to explain content that you don't understand,
that should usually result in them **rewriting the content more clearly**.

**Explanations written only in the code review tool are not helpful to future readers.**
They are acceptable only in a few circumstances, such as when
you are reviewing an area you are not familiar with and the author
explains something that normal readers of the code would have already known.
