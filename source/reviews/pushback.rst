Handling Pushback In Code Reviews
=================================

Sometimes an author will push back on a review. Either they will disagree
with your suggestion or they will complain that you are being too strict in
general.

Who Is Right
------------

When a author disagrees with your suggestion, first take a moment to consider
if they are correct. Often, they are closer to the content than you are, and so
they might really have a better insight about certain aspects of it. Does their
argument make sense? Does it make sense from a content health perspective? If so,
let them know that they are right and let the issue drop.

However, authors are not always right. In this case the reviewer should
further explain why they believe that their suggestion is correct. A good
explanation demonstrates both an understanding of the author's reply, and
additional information about why the change is being requested.

In particular, when the reviewer believes their suggestion will improve content
health, they should continue to advocate for the change if they believe the
resulting content quality improvement justifies the additional work requested.
**Improving content health tends to happen in small steps.**

Sometimes it takes a few rounds of explaining a suggestion before it really
sinks in. Just make sure to always stay polite and let the author know that
you *hear* what they're saying, you just don't *agree*.

Upsetting Authors
-----------------

Reviewers sometimes believe that the author will be upset if the reviewer
insists on an improvement. Sometimes authors do become upset, but it is
usually brief and they become very thankful later that you helped them improve
the quality of their content. Usually, if you are polite in your comments,
authors actually don't become upset at all, and the worry is just in the reviewer's
mind. Upsets are usually more about *the way comments are written* than about
the reviewer's insistence on content quality.

Cleaning It Up Later
--------------------

A common source of push back is that authors (understandably) want to get
things done. They don't want to go through another round of review just to get
this PR in. So, they say they will clean something up in a later PR or capture it
in a ticket, and thus you should LGTM *this* PR now. Some authors are very good
about this, and will immediately write a follow-up PR that fixes the issue.
However, experience shows that as more time passes after a authors writes the
original PR, the less likely this clean up is to happen. In fact, unless the
author does the clean up *immediately* after the present PR, it often never happens.
This isn't because authors are irresponsible, but because they have a lot of work
to do and the cleanup gets lost or forgotten in the press of other work. Thus, it
is usually best to insist that the author clean up their PR *now*, before the
content is in the corpus and "done." Letting people "clean things up later" is a
common way for corpus to degenerate.

If a PR introduces new sections, it must be cleaned up before submission
unless it is an emergency. If the PR exposes surrounding problems and they
can't be addressed right now, the author should file a ticket for the
cleanup and assign it to themselves so that it doesn't get lost.

Strictness
----------

If you previously had fairly lax reviews and you switch to having strict
reviews, some authors will complain very loudly. Improving the speed of
your reviews usually causes these complaints to fade away.

Sometimes it can take months for these complaints to fade away, but eventually
authors tend to see the value of strict reviews as they see what great
content they help generate. Sometimes the loudest protesters even become your
strongest supporters once something happens that causes them to really see the
value you're adding by being strict.

Conflicts
---------

If you are following all of the above but you still encounter a conflict
between yourself and an author that can't be resolved, see
:ref:`the Standard of Code Review <pr-standard>` for guidelines and
principles that can help resolve the conflict, and the
:ref:`reviewer guidelines <pr-courtesy>`.
