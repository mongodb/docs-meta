Do
++

- Assume competence and goodwill. We attract competent people - and that
  means even when they're wrong, it most likely comes from lack of information,
  not from inability.

- Discuss in person. If there is a disagreement, have a quick in-person/video/Slack
  chat to sort out what is going on - it's much easier to address all the little
  "Oh, I didn't know"s in a single face-to-face, instead of back-and-forth via e-mail
  with long delays. “In person” doubly applies if you are disagreeing with another
  reviewer. And please make sure to record the outcomes on the review.

- Explain why. It might be obvious to you that some content is wrong, but it's
  probably not obvious to the author — or they wouldn't have written it that way.
  Please don't say “This is wrong”. Instead, explain at least what the right
  way looks like. Or even better, explain why they should do things differently.
  And if you're the slightest bit uncertain, “Maybe I'm missing something, but…”
  is a helpful sentence. Remember, assume competence.

- Ask for the why. If it is unclear why the author is doing things a certain way,
  feel free to ask why they made a particular change. Not knowing is OK, and asking
  “Why” leaves a written record that will help answer this question in the future.
  Sometimes, “I'm curious, why did you decide to do it that way?” can help the author
  to rethink their decision.

- Find an end. If you like things neat, it's tempting to go over a review over and
  over until it's perfect, dragging it out for longer than necessary. It's soul-deadening
  for the recipient, though. Keep in mind that “LGTM” does not mean “I vouch my
  immortal soul this good”, but “looks good to me”. If it looks good, move on.
  That doesn't mean you shouldn't be thorough. It's a judgment call.
  And if there are bigger refactorings to be done, move them to a new PR.

- Reply within a reasonable time frame. Please don't leave the reviewee waiting
  for a long time, keeping in mind timezones and different working hours. If you
  cannot get to a review within ~24h, please leave a short comment on the PR
  saying so (and when you can). And if you missed that window, please be courteous
  if the reviewee sends you a reminder.

- If you will be on vacation or otherwise OOO for more than a few days, please
  set your status in the Slack to indicate this (e.g. adding '(OOO until )') and
  blocking your calendar.

- Mention the positives. It's very easy to get into the mindset of “find ALL the flaws”,
  but acknowledging the positives helps keep things civil, and brightens the recipient's
  day. No need to be all fake smiles, but if there's a good decision, or if somebody takes
  on a really grungy task, acknowledging that is a nice thing to do.
  Conversely, a “thank you” to the reviewers is occasionally a nice thing, too.

Don't
+++++

- Don't shame people. “How could you not see this” is a very unhelpful thing to say.
  Assume that your colleagues do their best, but occasionally make mistakes. That's
  why we have reviews - to spot those mistakes. While flawless PRs are awesome,
  flawed ones are the norm.

- Don't use extreme or very negative language. Please don't say things like
  “no sane person would ever do this” or “this is terrible”, whether it's about
  the PR you're reviewing or about the surrounding content. While it might
  intimidate the reviewee into doing what you want, it's not helpful in the long run -
  they will feel incapable, and there is not much info in there to help them improve.
  “This is a good start, but it could use some work” or “This needs some cleanup”
  are nicer ways of saying it. Discuss the content, not the person.

- Don't discourage tool use. If people use the automated formatter, be grateful
  they're willing to give up the power of formatting in favor of ensuring consistency.
  Think carefully before enforcing your own preferences over it.

- Don't bike shed. Always ask yourself if this decision really matters in the long
  run, or if you're enforcing a subjective preference. It feels good to be right,
  but only one of the two participants can win that game. If it's not important,
  agree to disagree, and move on.
