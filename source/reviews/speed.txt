Speed of Reviews
================

Why Reviews Should Be Fast
--------------------------

**At MongoDB, we optimize for the speed at which a team of authors can produce
content together**, as opposed to optimizing for the speed at which an
individual author can write content. The speed of an individual is
important, it's just not *as* important as the velocity of the entire team.

When content reviews are slow, several things happen:

-   **The velocity of the team as a whole is decreased.** Yes, the individual
    who doesn't respond quickly to the review gets other work done. However, new
    features and bug fixes for the rest of the team are delayed by days, weeks,
    or months as each PR waits for review.
-   **Authors start to protest the review process.** If a reviewer only
    responds every few days, but requests major changes to the PR each time,
    that can be frustrating and difficult for authors. Often, this is
    expressed as complaints about how "strict" or "nit picky" the reviewer
    is being. If the reviewer requests the *same* substantial changes
    (changes which really do improve content health), but responds *quickly*
    every time the developer makes an update, the complaints tend to disappear.
    **Most complaints about the content review process are resolved by making the
    process faster.**
-   **Content health can be impacted.** When reviews are slow, there is increased
    pressure to allow developers to submit PRs that are not as good as they
    could be. Slow reviews also discourage content cleanups, refactoring, and
    further improvements to existing PRs.

How Fast Should Content Reviews Be?
--------------------------------

If you are not in the middle of a focused task, **you should do a review
shortly after it comes in.**

**One business day is the maximum time it should take to respond** to a content
review request (i.e., first thing the next morning).

Following these guidelines means that a typical PR should get multiple rounds of
review (if needed) within a single day.

Speed vs. Interruption
----------------------

**If you are in the middle of a focused task, such as writing content,
don't interrupt yourself to do a content review.**

Research has shown that it can take a long time for an author to get back into a
smooth flow of work after being interrupted. Interrupting yourself while writing
is actually *more* expensive to the team than making another author wait a bit
for a review.

Instead, wait for a break point in your work before you respond to a request for
review. This could be when your current task is completed, after lunch,
returning from a meeting, coming back from the restroom, etc.

Fast Responses
--------------

When we talk about the speed of reviews, it is the *response* time that we
are concerned with, as opposed to how long it takes a PR to get through the
whole review and be accepted. The whole process should also be fast, ideally,
but it's even more important for the *individual responses* to come quickly
than it is for the whole process to happen rapidly.

Even if it sometimes takes a long time to get through the entire review
*process*, having quick responses from the reviewer throughout the process
significantly eases the frustration authors can feel with "slow" reviews.

If you are too busy to do a full review on a PR when it comes in, you can still
send a quick response that lets the author know when you will get to it,
suggest other reviewers who might be able to respond more quickly, or
provide some initial broad comments. (Note: none of this means
you should interrupt focus work to send a response; send the response at
a reasonable break point in your work.)

**It is important that reviewers spend enough time on review that they are
certain their "LGTM" means "this content meets :ref:`our standards <pr-standard>`"**
However, individual responses should still fast.

Cross-Time-Zone Reviews
-----------------------

When dealing with time zone differences, try to get back to the author when they
are still in their working hours. If they have already gone offline, then
try to make sure your review is done before they get back online the next day.

LGTM With Comments
------------------

In order to speed up reviews, there are certain situations in which a reviewer
should give LGTM/Approval even though they are also leaving unresolved
comments on the PR. This is done when either:

- The reviewer is confident that the author will appropriately address all
  the reviewer's remaining comments.
- The remaining changes are minor and don't *have* to be done by the
  author.

The reviewer should specify which of these options they intend if it is not
otherwise clear.

LGTM With Comments is especially worth considering when the author and
reviewer are in different time zones and otherwise the author would be
waiting for a whole day just to get "LGTM"

Large PRs

If somebody sends you a review that is so large you're not sure when you
will be able to have time to review it, your typical response should be to ask
the author to split the PRs into several smaller PRs that build on
each other, instead of one huge PR that has to be reviewed all at once. This is
usually possible and helpful to reviewers, even if it takes additional work
from the author.

If a PR *can't* be broken up into smaller PRs, and you don't have time to review
the entire thing quickly, then at least write some comments on the overall
design of the PR and send it back to the author for improvement. One of your
goals as a reviewer should be to always unblock the author or enable them to
take some sort of further action quickly, without sacrificing content health to do
so.

Review Improvements Over Time
-----------------------------

If you follow these guidelines and you are strict with your reviews, you
should find that the entire review process tends to go faster and faster
over time. Authors learn what is required for healthy content, and send
you PRs that are great from the start, requiring less and less review time.
Reviewers learn to respond quickly and not add unnecessary latency into
the review process.

Don't compromise on the :ref:`review standards <pr-standard>` or quality
for an imagined improvement in velocity. It isn't going to make anything
happen more quickly in the long run.

Emergencies
-----------

The following constitute emergencies where PRs must pass through the *whole*
review process quickly, and where the quality guidelines may be relaxed.
