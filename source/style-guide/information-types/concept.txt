A concept page helps a user learn about a concept or new feature. The page intends to 
answer the following questions:

- "What is this?"

- "Why do I care?"

- "How does this work?"

The audience includes users who have never used a particular feature or
command.

The title is typically a noun or noun phrase. 

A concept page begins with a brief introduction that summarizes its
contents, often called a short description. The short description
explains a little about the concept and why the audience should care
about it.

Command Syntax
--------------

Optional.

If it's appropriate, you may include a code-block with a copyable
prototype to familiarize users with command syntax.

.. code-block:: javascript

   db.collection.<method>( {
      /* command fields */
   } )

After the code block, provide a link to the corresponding
:ref:`reference <meta-reference-prototype>` or :ref:`task
<meta-task-prototype>` page to provide readers with complete examples
and behavior details. When possible, single-source code examples and
prototypes across pages.

.. note::

   For concept pages that have multiple linked tasks, the code example
   should show the most common task we expect users to look for.

Use Cases
---------

This section includes a collection of use cases to explain "What do I do
with this thing?" In general, use cases are short descriptions about how
to use a feature. They set expectations for when and how you might use a
feature and what differentiates this feature from other options.  

Behavior
--------

This section includes information you need to know before using a
feature. It can be as long or short as appropriate. Some examples of
technical details include:

- Performance considerations and behavior alerts

- Support for a feature (for example, sharded cluster support or
  Versioned API compatibility)

- Version support 

Get Started
-----------

Link to the most common task pages related to this concept. Linking to
all task pages isn't necessary here. The goal of this section is to make
sure users can easily find common related tasks.

- Link one
- Link two
- Link three

Details
-------

This section is a brief unpacking of the technical details. It can be as long
or short as appropriate.
