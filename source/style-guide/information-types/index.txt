The following sections describe information typing and provide
prototypes that show how to apply this strategy to our documentation.

What is Information Typing?
---------------------------

Information typing categorizes content by type based on your audience's
goals. Throughout the writing process, information typing helps keep the
information that you write focused on those goals.

Additionally, information typing accomplishes the following goals:

- Separate content into categories and delivers roughly one type at a
  time.

- Account for the purpose of a page before you write it.

- Answer the user question "why do I care?" or "what does this mean for
  me?" quickly.

- Use a suggested format to help you get started on a blank page.

What Information Types Do We Use?
---------------------------------

Currently, some teams use the following information types:

Concept
  .. include:: /includes/info-typing/concept-overview.rst

Task
  Helps a user do a job. The audience includes users who want to
  accomplish a particular goal. They might approach this task for the
  very first time, have limited experience, or need a refresher. This
  page should contain all the necessary information for someone to
  complete the task, any necessary conceptual information,
  prerequisites, steps, and expected results. 

Reference
  Delivers granular details about a topic. The audience includes
  experienced users. Reference pages may describe the use of a method,
  operator, or database command.
