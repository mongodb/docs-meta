A reference page provides quick information to experienced users of a
product. Reference pages may describe the use of a method, operator, or
database command. Release notes are another example of reference page.

Usually, the title of a reference page is the name of the command, operator, or 
method it describes.

Definition
----------

A reference page begins with a brief introduction summarizing its
contents, often called a short description. The short description
explains a little about how the reference material is used, and may link
to a concept or task page.

Syntax
------

This section includes the sample syntax with the required parameters. 

.. code-block:: javascript                                                 
                                                                           
   db.adminCommand(                                                        
      {                                                                    
        addShard: "<replica_set>/<hostname><:port>",                       
        maxSize: <size>,                                                   
        name: "<shard_name>"                                               
      }                                                                    
   )  

Command Fields
--------------

The command takes the following fields:

.. list-table::                                                            
   :header-rows: 1

     - Description

   * - Parameter

     - String

     - Required

     - String

Behaviors
---------

Optional. 

Behaviors should apply only to the operator described on this page. 

Examples
--------

Optional.

This section could contain examples of the most common use cases. Use
includes for Reference and Task page examples, so we write the examples
once, present them consistently throughout the documentation, and can
update them easily.

If an example is shared between task and reference, you should write it
as an include.
