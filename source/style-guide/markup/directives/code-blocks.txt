As needed, use the appropriate language option for code blocks directives
including the following directives:

- ``code-block``
- ``io-code-block``
- ``literalinclude``

These directives feature syntax highlighting that makes the source code 
contained in them easier to interpret.

Code Blocks
-----------

The ``code-block`` directive shows a code sample written inline in the same file. 
This directive supports the following options:

- Numbered lines
- To specify the language to use for syntax highlighting, include the language after 
  the directive.

The following example shows how to create a code block with the following options:

- Python language syntax highlighting

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   :copyable: false
   :emphasize-lines: 1-3, 6

   print("Hello MongoDB") # Python code
   print("Hello MongoDB") # Python code
   print("Hello MongoDB") # Python code
   print("Hello MongoDB") # Python code
   print("Hello MongoDB") # Python code
   print("Hello MongoDB") # Python code
