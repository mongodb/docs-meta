Search Engine Optimization Guidelines
=====================================

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) considers the actual terms that users 
enter into search engines (keywords) and employs best practices to 
improve traffic to web pages from search engines. The following 
guidance should help you optimize your documentation pages for search.

Titles
------

Use the following SEO best practices for page and subsection titles:

- Use a maximum of 70 characters.

- Include target keywords (the actual terms that users 
  enter into search engines to reach your page).

- Avoid excessive or irrelevant words (keyword stuffing).

- Strive for unique page titles. Identical titles, even between 
  documentation sets, might compete in search results.
  
To learn more, see :ref:`titles-and-headings`.

Alternative Text
----------------

Screen readers read alternative text for images aloud so that users can 
better understand an image. Specify alternative text according to the 
following SEO best practices:

- Use a maximum of 125 characters per image.

- Describe the image with sufficient detail to understand what it shows.

- If they apply to the image, include keywords 
  (the actual terms that users enter into search engines).

Keywords
--------

You can add the actual terms that users enter into search engines 
(keywords) to your page to improve its SEO. Add keywords according to 
the following best practices:

- Take the most concise form of the information that the page conveys 
  and make that the target keyword.

  .. example::

     The target keyword for the `Getting Started with MongoDB Atlas 
     <https://learn.mongodb.com/courses/getting-started-with-mongodb-atlas>`_ University page is 
     ``mongodb atlas course``.

- Don't add keywords so broad that they compete with the product page.

- Don't add keywords so specific that we miss the actual behavior of 
  our searchers. For example, add “mongodb atlas course” instead of 
  “Getting Started with Atlas Data Platform”.

While keyword tags are available, some search engines might ignore 
these tags. To learn more, see :ref:`metadata`.

Descriptions
------------

The description is a snippet that appears under the link in the search 
results, which can impact SEO. Write these descriptions according to 
the following best practices:

- Use a concise description of the page content that is enticing, if 
  possible.

- Emphasize the “why” for using the page.

- Use a maximum of 155 characters.

- Include target keywords and a call to action (CTA) that prompts the 
  user to complete their desired task.

  .. example::

     The following examples use a CTA in the description meta tag:

     .. code-block:: rst
	     
	      .. meta::
	         :description: Use a language analyzer to create search keywords in your Atlas Search index that are optimized for a particular natural language.

     .. code-block:: rst
	     
	      .. meta::
	         :description: Use the character filters in an Atlas Search custom analyzer to examine text one character at a time and perform filtering operations.

- Use unique descriptions for every page.
