Callouts and Admonitions
========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Callouts or admonitions emphasize important or helpful information.
To avoid clutter on the page and to preserve visual impact, use callouts
sparingly.

Callout Anatomy
---------------

A callout contains the following parts:

1. Label that indicates the callout type
2. Optional title
3. Body text

Callout Types
-------------

You can use the following callouts:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 60 30
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Callout Type
     - Description
     - Directive
   * - Tip
     - Provides useful information that might improve product
       performance or make procedures easier to follow. Tips provide
       the following benefits:

       - Help users learn techniques or procedures
       - Show alternative ways of doing something
       - Provide shortcuts
       - Provide helpful (but not essential) information

     - ``.. tip:: <title>``

   * - Note
     - Provides information that emphasizes or supplements information
       in the text. A note can provide information that applies only in
       certain cases.
     - ``.. note:: <title>``
   * - Important
     - Presents an important or essential point. As a rule, users must
       pay attention to important callouts to complete a task or
       understand a topic.
     - ``.. important:: <title>``
   * - Warning
     - Alerts users to potential hazards or highlights critical
       information. Use a warning for situations in which users could
       lose data, compromise data integrity, or disrupt operations if
       they don't follow instructions carefully.
     - ``.. warning:: <title>``

Callout Guidelines
------------------

When you create callouts, use the following guidelines:

- Use the callout type to convey the kind of information you want 
  to communicate. Don't rely on color to convey intensity. Don't change 
  the callout label.

  .. figure:: /images/callout-label.png
     :alt: callout label
     :align: center
     :figwidth: 700px

- Use the correct {+rst+} directive to create the callout. Don't 
  attempt to create callouts using boldface, headings, or custom
  :abbr:`CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)`.

- Don't stack multiple callouts directly after one another, as these can
  distract users. To avoid stacking callouts, group supplemental 
  information from callouts into a dedicated section.

- If possible, don't use callouts in tables and option lists
  Callouts reduce the scannability of tables and options lists.

- Avoid nesting callouts inside tables and other elements.

- Avoid nesting code blocks inside callouts.

- Place a callout as close as possible to the information that it
  emphasizes or clarifies.

- Avoid stacking callouts of the same type. For example, avoid adding
  one labeled note directly after another labeled note. Instead, use
  a single callout that contains separate paragraphs or an unordered 
  list.

- Use callouts for long form text and avoid using callouts for links 
  only.

- Use callouts only when absolutely needed and avoid overcrowding the 
  page with callouts.

The following callouts might appear in existing documentation but are
deprecated. Don't use these callouts in new content:

- ``.. admonition::``
- ``.. caution::``
- ``.. danger::``
- ``.. example::``
- ``.. see``
- ``.. see also``
- ``.. topic::``
