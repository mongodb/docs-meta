Links and Cross-References
==========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. include:: /includes/styles/corrections.rst

Use cross-references to:

- Help users navigate content
- Find content related to what they're currently viewing.

You can add hyperlinks to cross-references.

.. note::

   {+Rst+} refers to text that points to other sections in the current document or in another document, or to other documents as
   :sphinx-rst:`cross-references </roles.html#cross-referencing-syntax>`. Cross-references can include hyperlinks. You would use an {+rst+} role to format add a hyperlink to a cross-reference.
   {+Rst+} refers to hyperlinks to other specific URLs as
   :sphinx-rst:`links </basics.html#hyperlinks>`. This document uses cross-reference and link somewhat interchangeably.

-  When you refer to content within the same article or section, such
   as tables, figures, examples, or a subsection, create a simple
   textual cross-reference. If the referenced copy falls much further
   down the page, link to that content.

-  When you refer to other content, whether created by MongoDB or
   outside of MongoDB, provide a link to that content. Verify that the
   link works and that the content is current. Periodically check the
   link and content. If you link to Wikipedia or any other site that
   uses history, link to a specific revision of that page or content.

   .. example::

      .. code-block:: rst

         Timestamp in the number of seconds that have elapsed since the
         :wikipedia:`UNIX epoch </Unix_time?oldid=828172017>` when
         someone last updated this setting.

.. _sg-link-text:

Link and Cross-Reference Text
-----------------------------

Use the following guidelines to create clear and specific
cross-references. For examples, see the table at the end of
the topic.

- Begin a cross-reference sentence with the purpose or benefit of the
  cross-reference (such as more information or examples). Such context
  helps users decide whether to follow the reference.

- Use *To learn more about* rather than *For more information on*.

- Use *preceding* and *following* to locate information in an article
  or topic. Don't use *above*, *below*, *earlier*, or *later*.

- Ensure that the cross-refernce or link text sufficiently describes
  the target content.

  - For links at the end of an article or topic that point to related
    information or to a next step, use the title of or a heading in the
    target content as the link text.

  - When links are inline, use about three or four words of existing
    text as the link text. Choose words that best describe the
    target content.

  - If existing text can't sufficiently describe the target
    content, create a cross-reference sentence for the link. For the
    link text, use the title of or a heading in the target
    content, if possible. Avoid providing an actual URL, unless you
    think that having the URL is helpful for the user.

  - Don't provide links from ambiguous phrases such as *Click here* or
    *More information*.

  .. note::

     - Provide links *inline* only when it's necessary or helpful for
       the user to follow the link to understand the current topic or
       complete the task.

     - Provide links to related but not essential information, and to
       next steps, at the end of the article or section, preferrably
       under a ``.. seealso::`` directive.

- If a link points to a location other than the current site (for
  example, out of the Support website or away from
  docs.mongodb.com), provide context that describes the location.

.. _sg-link-formatting:

Link and Cross-Reference Formatting
-----------------------------------

- Don't code a link to open in a new tab or window. Users can choose
  whether they want open a link in a new tab or window.

- If your article or topic has multiple subheadings, provide a TOC
  (jump list) at the beginning of the article or topic, after an
  introduction. Use the heading text as the link text, and typically
  link only to the top-level headings in the article or topic.

  .. note::

     Don't create a TOC within the article manually. Add the
     ``.. contents::`` directive to generate a TOC.

- Don't use quotation marks around link text.

- Create and format links using either:

  - custom roles (like ``:rfc:``, ``:manual:`` or ``:gh:``), or
  - standard {+rst+}
    :sphinx-rst:`external links </basics.html#external-links>` ending
    with two underscores instead of one.

    .. note::

       The documentation rendering engine expects links to be unique if
       they end with only one underscore. If you create two links to
       the same URL with only one underscore, the engine returns a
       build error. If you end the link with two underscores, the
       engine creates modifies subsequent URLs to prevent this build
       error.

- Test links to ensure that they're live and that they point to
  the correct target.

- Don't link to information more than once in an article or topic.
