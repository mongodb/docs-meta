===========================
Placeholder (Variable) Text
===========================

Placeholder text (also referred to as variable text or replaceable
text) stands for an object whose specific name is unknown to us.
Placeholders are included when documenting syntax for how a command or
path should be constructed. Users supply the relevant value for the
placeholder when using the command or syntax.

Placeholder text usually indicates the type of element that's being
represented. For example, *directoryName* would likely indicate the
name of a directory.

.. note::

   Placeholder text is distinct from *environment variables*.
   Environment variables have established formats and names, such as
   ``$account``, and their values are set in the system by users and
   used consistently. By contrast, a placeholder is given a relevant
   value by the user at the time that the user runs the code or types
   the path. For information about formatting environment variables,
   see :ref:`text-formatting`.

When creating placeholder text, use the following guidelines.

.. note::

   For specific information about showing placeholders for account
   information such as account numbers, usernames, passwords, and API
   keys, see :ref:`cloud-account-info`.

   * - Guidelines
     - Example

   * - Within regular text, show placeholder text in italics.

       Within code samples, use the RST ``:samp:`` directive, and
       enclose the placeholder text in curly braces. This formatting
       renders the placeholder in italics.

       If you can't apply text formatting to the code, enclose
       placeholders in punctuation that doesn't have any other special
       use in the code. For example, use angle brackets or curly
       braces. Use a consistent convention throughout the documentation
       set.
     - :samp:`nova boot {serverName} --image {image} --flavor {flavor}
       --nic net-id=net1_id`

   * - Use lowercase letters except when showing a multiple-word
       placeholder.

       To show a multiple-word placeholder, don't separate the words
       with spaces or symbols. To distinguish the words in the
       placeholder, capitalize the first letter of each word after the
       first word (called camelCase). Don't capitalize the first word.

       .. note::
          Use lowercase and camelCase unless you have to follow the
          conventions of the programming language. For example, you
          might need to use underscores (account_ID) or all capitals
          (ACCOUNT_ID). 
     - *password* *serverName* *apiKey* *tenantId*

   * - In general, use one or more whole words to represent a
       placeholder. Don't sacrifice clarity for brevity. Create
       placeholders that are descriptive and meaningful.
     - *device* (instead of *dev*)

       *installationDirectory* (instead of *installDir*)

       *mode* (instead of *########*)

When explaining a placeholder, use the following guidelines.

   :header-rows: 1

   * - Guidelines
     - Example

   * - Avoid stand-alone clauses that begin with *where*. Instead, use
       a sentence.
     - *Use:*

       **https://dfw.bigdata.api.MongoDBcloud.com/v1.0/yourAccountId/**

       *yourAccountId* is your actual account number, which is returned
       as part of the authentication service response.

       *Avoid:*

       **https://dfw.bigdata.api.MongoDBcloud.com/v1.0/yourAccountId/**

       where *yourAccountId* is your actual account number, which is
       returned as part of the authentication service response.

   * - If you need to explain two or more placeholders, use an
       unordered list.
     - From a supported web browser, type the following URL:

       **http://hostName:portNumber/ed/index.html**

       The placeholders in the URL are defined as follows:

       - *hostName* is the name of the host computer on which the
         application server is installed.

       - *portNumber* is the port number assigned to the application
         server. The default is 8082.

   * - Show the placeholder in regular text with the same formatting
       that it's shown in the path or code. For example, if you can
       show it in italics, use italics when explaining it. If you
       first show the placeholder in a code block and need to enclose
       it in angle brackets, show it in angle brackets and monospace
       when explaining it.
     - *Use:*

       **https://dfw.bigdata.api.MongoDBcloud.com/v1.0/yourAccountId/**

       *yourAccountId* is your actual account number, which is returned
       as part of the authentication service response.

       *Use:*

       Run the following command, replacing ``<dockerHostName>`` with
       the name of your Docker host:

       ``docker-machine env <dockerHostName> --shell cmd``
