Verbs carry the action in a sentence, and they make your content come
alive for users. To make the biggest impact with your writing, use
strong, simple, action verbs. See the following sections for specific
guidelines.

.. _use-action-oriented-verbs:

Use action-oriented verbs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verbs are supposed to carry the action in a sentence. However, when you
use verbs like *be*, *have*, *make*, or *do* (and their variants), or
when you use gerunds (*-ing* words), nouns carry the action and weaken
the meaning. Shift the focus from nouns to verbs by replacing weak
verbs and gerunds with strong, action-oriented verbs. Relying on verbs
rather than nouns usually makes sentences shorter, clearer, and more
direct.

.. _avoid-nouns-built-from-verbs:

Avoid nouns built from verbs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many nouns are built from verbs, for example, *description* and
*explanation*. Such nouns are called *nominalizations*. Sentences that
include a nominalization *and* a verb can often be simplified by
changing the nominalization back into a verb and omitting the existing
verb (as shown in the following examples).

       following tasks.
   * - The program **encrypts** user IDs and passwords.
     - The program **enables the encryption of** user IDs and
       passwords.

.. _use-simplest-tense:

Use the simplest tense
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Simple verbs, such as verbs in the present tense, are easier to read
and understand than complex verbs, such as verbs in the progressive or
perfect tense, or verbs combined with helping verbs (such as *can*,
*may*, *might*, *must*, and *should*).

.. _helping-verbs:

Use modal verbs accurately
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modal verbs are helping verbs that further modify the action or meaning
of the main verb. If you need to use the following helping or modal
verbs, use them accurately and consistently:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 10 45 45
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Modal verb
     - Description
     - Example
   * - can
     - Indicates the ability to perform an action.
     - You **can** customize Cloud Queues to achieve a wide range of
       performance, durability, availability, and efficiency goals.
   * - may
     - Indicates permission.
     - If you need space, you **may** uninstall the program.
   * - might
     - Indicates probability or possibility.
     - A service **might** expose endpoints in different regions.
   * - must
     - Indicates the necessity of an action.
       However, in general, use the imperative mood, which implies the
       subject *you* and doesn't require *must* but still indicates
       necessity.
     - The worker **must** delete the message when work is done.
   * - should
     - Indicates a recommendation or an expectation. Avoid using
       should, because it implies uncertainty or could imply a best
       practice (which we might or might not want to do).
     - To avoid losing a claim in the middle of processing a message,
       clients **should** periodically renew claims during long-running
       batches of work.

.. _use-single-word-verbs:

Use single-word verbs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When possible, use single-word verbs rather than phrasal verbs (verbs
followed by prepositions or adverbs). For example, use *omit* rather
than *leave out*, or shorten *start up* to *start*. One-word verbs are
easier to understand and to translate.

If you must use a phrasal verb, keep the parts of the verb together
unless that changes the meaning of the sentence. Some acceptable
phrasal verbs are *back up*, *log in*, *set up*, *shut down*, and *work
around*.

.. note::

   Don't turn a phrasal verb into a single-word verb. For example,
   don't use *login*, *setup*, or *workaround* as verbs. These
   single-word terms should be used only as nouns or adjectives.

   * - You can safely **back up a database** by using MongoDB Cloud

       Backup.

.. _dont-use-verbs-as-nouns-or-adjectives:

Don't use verbs as nouns or adjectives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a word is defined in the dictionary as a verb, don't use it as a
noun or adjective. Some verbs that are commonly misused as nouns or
adjectives are *configure*, *compile*, *debug*, and *install*.

.. list-table::

   * - Correct

       the bottom of the output text.
     - When the **compile process** is finished, the following message
       appears at the bottom of the output text.

Don't use nonverbs as verbs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Don't use nouns or adjectives as verbs, and don't add verb suffixes to
abbreviations, nouns, or conjunctions.

     - Some databases and search engines **AND** adjacent words in a
       keyword search.
   * - **Navigate** to the new directory.
     - **CD** to the new directory.

Use transitive verbs transitively, not intransitively
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Transitive verbs, such as *display* and *complete*, require a direct
object. Intransitive verbs don't require a direct object. Be sure to
use each type of verb correctly.

To avoid using a transitive verb intransitively, you can make it
passive if the performer of the action is understood or not important.

   * - After the installation **is completed**, ensure that the FTP
       services are running.
     - After the installation **completes**, ensure that the FTP
       services are running.

Don't humanize inanimate objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Be careful not to ascribe human feelings, motivations, and actions to
inanimate objects. For example, a software program doesn't know, need,
remember, see, think, understand, or want.

Be careful not to ascribe human qualities, traits, or emotions to
inanimate objects like software, hardware, or interfaces. Often, we use
anthropomorphic words in an attempt to make difficult topics easier for
readers to understand or relate to. However, this can actually make the
concept harder to grasp for ESL readers or those less familiar with
metaphors. For example, a software program doesn't know, need,
remember, see, think, understand, or want.

However, there are standard anthropomorphic verbs in the computer
industry. For example, a software program can detect, record, require,
store, check, calculate, process, accept, calculate, deny, detect,
interact, interpret, listen, refuse, read, and write. You can use
anthropomorphic phrases standard to the industry to avoid awkward
sentence constructions, but do take the time to question common usage
and decide if thereâ€™s a better word.

In general, avoid phrases that convey intention or desire (such as
*needs* or *wants*), intellect (*thinks*, *knows*, or *realizes*), or
emotion (*likes* or *cares*).
