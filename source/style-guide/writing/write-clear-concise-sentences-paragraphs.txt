Users can understand wordy and complex writing, and they can wade through walls of text, but we shouldn't force them to. Use the following guidelines to help you write clear and concise sentences and paragraphs.

.. _use-consistent-sentence-structure:

Use a consistent sentence structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As often as possible, use the sentence structure *subject*—*verb*—*object*. Use simple declarative sentences for descriptions, and use simple imperative sentences for instructions. Sentences that describe a condition should always begin with the conditional clause, so that the user can stop reading and move on if the condition does not apply to them.

       clients from the host.

.. _restrict-sentence-length:

Restrict sentence length
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Even a well-written long sentence can be hard to follow and understand.
Try to limit sentences to 20-25 words. If you must write a longer
sentence, it should have more than one clause, and the relationship
between the clauses should be clear.

   * - After you choose a data center, the app retrieves a list of the

       Overwrite files with the same name or restore the files to their
       original folders and then click the **Next** button.

.. _use-necessary-words:

Use the necessary words
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Technical writing isn't creative writing. Use only the words necessary
to convey the meaning, and strip out anything extraneous. For example,
are you using adverbs (modifiers ending in *-ly*)? If so, you can
remove most of them without changing the meaning. What about
adjectives? If they aren't necessary to the meaning, remove them. Can
prepositional phrases be shortened? Are you using empty phrases that
don't clarify the content?

Conversely, be sure to include all the words that *are* necessary to
make the meaning of a sentence clear. Include all necessary articles
(*a*, *an*, *the*), prepositions, connectors, and other syntactic cues,
such as those described in :ref:`clarify-gerunds-participles`,
:ref:`use-that-which-correctly`, and :ref:`use-pronouns-carefully`.

.. _create-short-paragraphs:

Create short paragraphs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Short paragraphs are easier to scan and understand than longer ones.
Use the following guidelines for paragraphs:

- Cover only one idea in each paragraph.
- Limit paragraphs to four to five sentences. However, avoid having
  one-sentence paragraphs.
- Use connective or transitional words to ensure flow within and
  between paragraphs.
- When listing three or more items, use a bullet list instead of
  embedding the items in a paragraph.

The following examples show how breaking up a long paragraph by using a
list makes it easy for the user to scan the text.
