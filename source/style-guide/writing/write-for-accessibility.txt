According to the `World Health Organization <https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health>__`, 15 percent of the world's population has an accessibility need. Writing with accessibility in mind improves the documentation experience for all our users.

Use Descriptive Language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Do not identify UI elements by only one sensory characteristic (such as color or location).

Directional phrases like “at the top of the page” or "right-hand side" might not provide adequate information to someone using a screen reader. Even relating one element to another with phrases like “next to” or “above” might not provide enough context. Be as descriptive as possible when locating elements on the UI by using headings, field names, panels, or modals, and where they are relative to each other.

Use the label of an element and not its shape or color to describe it.

Not recommended: Click ... button.
Recommended: In the Clusters view, click the ellipses … button next to the cluster you want to modify.
Color
When someone is visually impaired or colorblind, using language that describes an element only by its physical characteristics isn’t helpful.

Not recommended: Click the green button.
Recommended: Click Save.


General dos and don'ts
- Avoid unnecessary font formatting. (Screen readers explicitly describe text modifications.)
- Don’t force line breaks (hard returns) within sentences and paragraphs. Line breaks might not work well in resized windows or with enlarged text.
- Avoid camel case and all caps. Some screen readers read capitalized letters individually, and some languages are unicase.
- Depending on the screen reader (or personal settings), not all punctuation marks are read. Make sure the same meaning is conveyed to the reader without punctuation marks. For that reason, avoid the use of exclamation marks, question marks, and semicolons.
- Don't use & instead of and in headings, text, navigation, or tables of contents; however, it's OK to use & when referencing UI elements that use &, or in table headings and diagram labels where space constraints require abbreviation. And of course it's fine to use & for technical purposes in code.

Reading ease
- Break up walls of text to aid in scannability. For example, separate paragraphs, create headings, and use lists.
- Use shorter sentences. Try to use fewer than 26 words per sentence.
- Define acronyms and abbreviations on first usage and if they're used infrequently.
- Use parallel writing structures for similar things. For example, start each list in the same format.
- Place distinguishing and important information of a paragraph in the first sentence to aid in scannability.

Headings and titles
- Use descriptive headings and titles because they help a user navigate their browser and the page. It's easier to jump between pages and sections of a page if the headings and titles are unique.

Use a heading hierarchy.
- Don't skip levels of the heading hierarchy. For example, put an <h3> only under an <h2>.
- To change the visual formatting of a heading, use CSS rather than using a heading level that doesn't fit the hierarchy.
- Don't have empty headings or headings with no associated content.
- Tag headings using heading elements. In HTML: <h1>, <h2>, and so on. In Markdown: #, ##, and so on.
- Use a level-1 heading for the page title or main content heading.

Links
- Use meaningful link text. Links should make sense when read out of context.
- Don't use click here or read this document. Some people who use screen readers jump from link to link to scan a page and need to understand what a link contains.
- Use an external link icon to indicate that the link opens in a new window or tab.
- Avoid adjacent links or put a character in between to separate them.
- If a link downloads a file, the link text needs to indicate this action as well as the file type.

Images
- For every image, provide alt text that adequately summarizes the intent of each image.
- Don't present new information in images; always provide an equivalent text explanation with the image.
- Don't repeat images unless absolutely necessary.
- Don't use images of text, code samples, or terminal output. Use actual text.
- Use SVG instead of PNG if available. SVGs stay sharp when you zoom in on the image.

Videos, recordings, and GIFs
- Provide captions, transcripts, or descriptions of audio and video content. For example, you can use the autocaption feature in YouTube.
Ensure that captions can be translated into major languages.
- Avoid flickering or flashing elements. They can cause anything from motion sickness to a seizure.

Tables
- Don't use tables unless it's the best method to present your information. Tables are challenging for screen readers. If you must use a table, use a simple table.
- Avoid tables in the middle of a numbered procedure.

Don't use tables unless it's the best method to present your information. Tables are challenging for screen readers. For more information, see List or table.
Forms
Label every input field, using a <label> element.
Place labels outside of fields.
When you're creating an error message for form validation, clearly state what went wrong and how to fix it. For example: "Name is a required field."

Document rendering
Make sure that your document conveys all the information you intended if you view it in the following contexts:

Without sound
Using only sound
Without color
Using a keyboard
With screen magnification
Without punctuation
Don't use color, size, location, or other visual cues as the primary way of communicating information.

If you're using color, icon, or outline thickness to convey state, then also provide a secondary cue, such as a change in the text label.
Refer to buttons and other elements by their label. For example:

Not recommended: Click the round button.

Recommended: Click Save.

Don't use directional language to orient the reader, such as above, below, or right-hand side. This type of language doesn't work well for accessibility or for localization reasons. If a UI element is hard to find, provide a screenshot.

Not recommended: In the left-side panel, click the button with three lines.

Recommended: Click Menu menu.
